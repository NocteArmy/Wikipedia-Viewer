# Wikipedia Viewer
This is a Wikipedia Viewer App created as per the instructions on freeCodeCamp for the legacy Front End Developer Certificate. The app allows the user to click a link to a random Wikipedia page or enter search parameters and the app will return the top 10 pages based on the search parameters.

There is a working version of this repo at the following link: [Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/noctearmy/pen/XqpYja)
